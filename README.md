Machine Learning & Statistics 
//A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains what the project is about.//

The main files in this repository are the Project and Tasks Jupyter files. These give an overview of Statistics, Machine learning and the use of Python to explore these concepts.

These were completed as part of a HDip in Data Analysis for Atlantic Technical University (Formally GMIT)

Motivation
// A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.//

By reviewing these files I hope to provide the reader with a greater understanding of the statistical concepts and also how Python can be used to explore these concepts. 

This repository is made up of data files, images but also Jupyter notebooks; which will allow for greater access to viewers. The code in these Jupyter Notebooks can be viewed, run and interacted with by a user using with varying degrees of programming ability...or no programming experience. Viewing and interaction with these files can be completed with or without downloading and installing a full Python package, which I will detail further.
